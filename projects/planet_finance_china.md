<p>I co-led a five-person team to research and design a suite of financial education tools for female, microloan borrowers in China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The project was funded by Diageo, the multinational beverages company, as a part of their initiative to improve the lives of women in developing parts of the world.</p>

<p>I conducted on-site user interviews and focus groups in Chinese to assess and understand the microloan credit cycle, household cash flows, and financial literacy levels. Research findings guided the design and development of four financial tools that reach borrowers and credit officers at different points in the borrowing experience.</p>

<p>This project was my first exposure to Human-centered Design. Seeing the ability of the design process to solve problems outside the aesthetic inspired me to pursue a career in design.</p>
