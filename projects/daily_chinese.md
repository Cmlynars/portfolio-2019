<p>I designed, managed, and shipped a mobile app for <a class="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-chinese-flashcards/id1468602303?ign-mpt=uo%3D2" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a class="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojayllc.dailychinese" target="_blank">Android</a> to help Chinese learners grow and track their Chinese vocabulary.</p>

<p>As a solo founder working with a remote developer, I am executing all of the design, project management, marketing, and content strategy components of the product. More information about the app can be found <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.dailychinese.app" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
