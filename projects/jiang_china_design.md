<p>I mentored 40 college students at China's first human-centered design bootcamp during the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>I guided and instructed students on all aspects of the design process including generative user research, ideation, prototyping, testing, and delivery.</p>

<p>My team ultimately prototyped a design to improve the public workout spaces found throughout China. The design increases use of these spaces by reimagining the layout and features of the space to meet the needs and social organization habits of the community.</p>
